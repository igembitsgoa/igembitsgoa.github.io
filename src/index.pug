                        h2 Tonnes of sugar are lost every year as post-harvest losses. 
                            span We're here to change that.

                            Describe how the sugar industry is doomed and how revolutionary our project is. Basically a 
                            textual description of the problem and our solution, essentially repeating content from 
                            the animation above. Maybe add some numbers to put it into perspective. For people who don't
                            want to go through the animation but want a quick 
                            description. 
                        p.
                            The following sections summarize each important aspect of our project. I think it's best if we
                            cover all the medal criteria here (except the boring ones like attributions and all) so that 
                            the most important information is highlighted front and center. 
                        p.
                            The fact that a syn bio solution is better than just injecting invertase inhibitor also has to be
                            mentioned somewhere prominent. Not sure where though.

                            principles used" and "Experimental plan to test your designs." It also asks for design iterations
                            but home page is probably not the right place for that. Safety section is at the bottom, but maybe
                            briefly mention the killswitch as well?
                        p.
                            Also talk about the delivery mechanism. Maybe this is the right place to mention why we went 
                            with a syn bio solution instead of just injecting the inhibitor.

                            Headline too cringey? Questionable color choice? Apparently orange is the color of 
                            communication. It's a really hard color to work with, though. Increasing saturation any
                            more hurts my eyes, reducing it saturation makes orange lose its effect and reducing 
                            brightness makes it dull. Btw, scroll up for an inverted Indian flag.

                            Also write about Abhighyan insta posts? Is that sci-comn or public engagement?

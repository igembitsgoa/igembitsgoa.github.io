        # Motivation

        Our project rests on the premise that our genetically modified organism — *Escherichia coli*, was able to replicate 
        and survive in the sugarcane system, at least long enough to serve its purpose. Fortunately, we were able to perform the 
        experiments required to support these claims in a laboratory setting. As it would have been rather difficult to measure 
        the growth of *E. coli* directly inside the sugarcane matrix, we extracted the juice from a sugarcane plant and cultured 
        our bacterium in this medium and performed optical density (OD at 600nm) measurements on the liquid at regular intervals 
        of time, specifically one hour intervals. This experiment was performed three times, and as a consequence three sets of 
        optical density measurements were obtained. The averages of the three were calculated and are tabulated below.

        The optical density was subsequently converted to population size (in the units cfu/mL) using the conversion ratio 
        \\( 1 \text{OD} \\) = \\( 10^{-6} \text{cfu/mL} \\). Then, the data was converted to the semi-log domain by calculating 
        the logarithm (base 10) of the optical density data while retaining the time series data as it is.

        # Mathematical Model

        We selected a simple logistic equation to model the growth of the bacteria. At this moment, we would also like to state 
        that other models — like Gompertz, Stannerd or Richards exist [Zwietering et. al, 1990](#citation1), but we felt that a 
        logistic model best suited our data and purpose. 

        Developed in 1838 by Belgian mathematician Pierre-François Verhulst, a logistic model makes the assumption that the rate 
        of population growth is limited and is dependent on the size of the population at any particular instant of time. Specifically, 
        the rate of growth \\( r \\) is equal to

        $$
            r = r_0\left(1 - \frac{N}{N_{\text{max}}}\right)
        $$

        Since the rate of population growth is directly proportional to the population size at that given time [Verhulst, 1838](#citation2), 
        we obtain the following differential equation governing the growth.

        $$
            \frac{dN}{dt} = rN
        $$

        $$
            \frac{dN}{dt} = r_0 N \left(1 - \frac{N}{N_{\text{max}}}\right)
        $$

        Here, \\( r_0 \\) is the maximum possible rate of population growth and \\( N_{\text{max}} \\) is the carrying capacity of the medium. 
        Solving the above ODE, we obtain the following closed-form solution for the population size as a function of time:

        $$
            N(t) = \frac{N_0N_{\text{max}}}{N_0 + (N_{\text{max}} - N_0)\cdot exp(-r_0 t)}
        $$

    :markdown-it(html)

        We initially solve the ODE using SciPy's `solve_ivp` method with an initial guess of the parameter \\( r_0 \\) set to 1. 
        We do not consider the carrying capacity \\( N_{\text{max}} \\) to be a variable parameter and set it to \\( 1 + 10^{-6} \\) times the maximum 
        population size in the data series obtained from experiment.

        Once a solution is obtained with these parameter values, we run an optimiser using SciPy's `minimize` method to modify the values of the parameter \\( r_0 \\) 
        to minimise the least-squares sum between the predictions and the actual population size (this serves as the cost function). This process is performed to fit our 
        growth curve to the data as neatly as possible. Once a minimum value for the parameter \\( r_0 \\) is obtained, we plot the final curve. Fitting the data to our curve, 
        we obtain the following growth function:

        $$
            N(t) = \frac{4.9777}{1 + 0.6592\cdot exp(-1.2017t)}
        $$

    :markdown-it(html)
        With this model (and experiment), we have shown that our organism is able to survive and replicate within the sugarcane matrix with a nontrivial growth rate and 
        that it reaches a sufficiently large population size. We have also obtained a closed-form growth function that models the growth of our bacteria in the sugarcane system.

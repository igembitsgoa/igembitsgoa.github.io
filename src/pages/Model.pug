        Mathematical models allow us to gain an insight into the functioning of a system and also allow us to hypothesise, predict and verify 
        its behaviour. Formulating a model therefore, provides a mathematical validation of the system created. Considering our restricted and 
        later on non-existent access to a laboratory environment due to COVID-19, these models are the cornerstone of our project — they lend it 
        legitimacy and validity in the absence of experimental proofs. Our project consists of four individual models which collectively complete 
        our project. These would be discussed in the following sections.

        # Growth Curve

        Before we proceeded with the specifics of our project such as the genetic design and such, it was imperative to show that 
        our specimen — *Escherichia coli*, was able to replicate and survive in the sugarcane system, at least long enough to serve 
        its purpose (Nietzsche is proud, maybe). Fortunately, the experiments required to support these claims could be performed in 
        a laboratory setting. As it would have been rather difficult to measure the growth of *E. coli* directly in the sugarcane matrix, 
        we extracted the juice from a sugarcane plant and cultured our bacterium in this medium and performed optical density (OD at 600nm) 
        measurements on the liquid at regular intervals of one hour. These readings were taken thrice and the averages of the three are tabulated below.

        The optical density was subsequently converted to population size (in the units cfu/mL) using the conversion
        ratio 1 OD = \\( 10^{-6} \\) cfu/mL. Then, the data was converted to the semi log domain by calculating the log (base 10) of
        the OD while retaining the time series as it is. 

        We selected a simple logistic equation to model the growth of the bacteria. At this moment, we would also like to state that
        other models — like Gompertz, Stannerd or Richards exist [Zwietering et. al, 1990](#citation1), but we felt that a logistic model best suited our data and purpose.

        $$
            r = r_0\left(1 - \frac{N}{N_{\text{max}}}\right)
        $$

        Since the rate of population growth is directly proportional to the population size at that given time [Verhulst, 1838](#citation2), we obtain the differential 
        equation governing the growth.

        $$
            \frac{dN}{dt} = rN
        $$

        $$
            \frac{dN}{dt} = r_0 N \left(1 - \frac{N}{N_{\text{max}}}\right)
        $$

        Here, \\( r_0 \\) is the maximum possible rate of population growth and \\( N_{\text{max}} \\) is the carrying capacity of the medium. 
        Solving the above ODE, we obtain the following closed-form solution for the population size as a function of time

        $$
            N(t) = \frac{N_0N_{\text{max}}}{N_0 + (N_{\text{max}} - N_0)\cdot exp(-r_0 t)}
        $$
    :markdown-it(html)
        We initially solve the ODE using SciPy's `solve_ivp` method with an initial guess of the parameter \\( r_0 \\) set to 1. 
        We do not consider the carrying capacity \\( N_{\text{max}} \\) to be a variable parameter and set it to \\( 1 + 10^{-6} \\) times the maximum 
        population size in the data series.

        Once a solution is obtained with these parameter values, we run an optimiser using SciPy's `minimize` method to modify the values of the parameter \\( r_0 \\) 
        to minimise the least-squares sum between the predictions and the actual population size (this serves as the cost function).
        When a minimum value for the parameter \\( r_0 \\) is obtained, we plot the final curve. Fitting the data to our curve, we obtain the growth function

        $$
            N(t) = \frac{4.9777}{1 + 0.6592\cdot exp(-1.2017t)}
        $$

        With this model, we have proved that our organism is able to survive and replicate within the sugarcane matrix with a nontrivial growth rate and 
        reaches a sufficiently large population size.
